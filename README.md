# Coffee-Shop-Daily-Revenue
A Machine Learning project done for personal practice, Goal of the project is to practice the use of Linear regression model to create a prediction model over 75% accuracy (will try for higher with minimum goal being 75% accuracy)

### Linear Regression:
**Definition:**  
Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a linear equation.

**How does it work:**  
It finds the best-fitting straight line that minimizes the error between actual data points and predicted values, usually using the least squares method.

**Use Case:**  
It is widely used in forecasting, trend analysis, and predictive modeling in fields like finance, healthcare, and marketing.

**Advantages and disadvantages:**  
Linear regression is simple, interpretable, and effective for linear relationships, but it struggles with complex, non-linear data and is sensitive to outliers.

### Project Information:
**Dataset Summary:**  
The Dataset contains 2000 records of data from coffee shops, for obtaining detailed understanding into factors that influence the daily revenue. Variables include key operational and enviromental variables that provide a comprehensive view of how business activities and external conditions affect sales performance.  

**Variable Information:**  
The variables contain operational details they include:  

1. Number of Customers per day
* Total number of customers visiting the shop on any random day
* Range: 50-500 customers
2. Average Order Value ($)
* The average amount spent by each customer during their visit (in dollars)
* Range: 2.5-10
3. Operating Hours per day
* Total number of hours the coffee shop is open each day for business
* Range: 6-17
